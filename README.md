# MyFirstPet
The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for first-time pet owners to 
have access to adoptable pets, resources, and public forums. The goal was to develop a secure application that provides its users 
access to important information for first-time pet owners. Therefore we created MyFirstPet which allowed users to have access to those things.

Steps to run the web application:
1. To run the web application you must first download MAMP (Web Developing Software) 
2. After installing MAMP, run the software and start the servers. 
3. Once the servers are running click on "Open Webstart page".
4. Next click on "Tools" and than "phpMyAdmin", here you will create a database. 
5. Create a new database by clicking on "New" in the left column and name it "myfirstpet"
6. After creating the database click on "import" and select "choose file". This is where you will select the file "myfirstpet.sql" and click on "Go".
7. Your database has now been imported
8. Now its time to import the web application files into your MAMP "htdocs" file directory. This will be located where you installed MAMP to. 
9. Copy the downloaded "htdocs" folder and past it in the MAMP directory. It will ask to replace the already created folder, select "Yes or continue".
10. Now head back to the webstart page and click on "My Website". You now have access to the web application and can use it however you choose to.
